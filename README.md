# CCC: Common C Code

This project is aimed at collecting, after a mindful cleanup, the code
that I find myself writing in a lot of my C projects.
I'm sharing this hoping that it could be useful to some people.

## Why?

In my spare time, I mostly program in C and C++.
Between the two, I have always preferred C, but C++ offers much more,
especially in terms of standard library.
When working on different C projects, I tend to implement the same data
structures over and over again, with a varying number of features,
so I decided to put an end to this and just have a proper implementation
for once.

## Features

* Fixed size types
* Min/Max
* Clamp
* Assert 
* Crash
* Error codes
* Fixed size stack
* Fixed size queue

## TODO

* Strings
* Hashing
* Linked lists
* Hash tables
* Binary trees
* Thread Array
